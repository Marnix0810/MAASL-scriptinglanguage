title: Internals
Description: "The internals are an exception, the internals are pre-processed without the mode to get in between, which means they are predefined and necessary to learn as a basis."

## What are internals?

Instead of loading or installing modules like for example [*Python*](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html), MAASL will have multiple modes, allowing to change how the code processor reads the code, and possible to download and run modes. It might even be possible for MAASL to transfer these modes over decentralized networks.

MAASL will have some internals that are handled before the modes can read them, *these work in **all** modes*.
